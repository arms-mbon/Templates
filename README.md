Various Word templates to use for ARMS data and sample collecting
- templates for the sample tube labels
- templates for plate labels (when photographing them)
- template for the Material Transfer Agreement

Also included is an excel file (ARMS_TemplateIDs-Manualobservations-ImageFileDescriptions.xlsx) with three sheets, these to help you conform to requirements with respect to your sampling IDs, your image file names, and how you report your manual observations (See the ARMS Handbook in https://github.com/arms-mbon/Documentation):
- how to create your ARMS event and sampling IDs, based on your ARMS unit and observatory name and the sampling dates
- how to describe your image filenames and link to their image IDs (so that all images can be properly identified)
- how to describe manual observations (with aphiaID, count, date, etc)
The documents can also be found on our googledrive: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXoHMll1-VoDuAv8X_azmLSRwVh68FB5WGsJ8Y6W3LQBut
